## Research question: 

How have wildfires in the United States and its territories impacted the economy, and what are the key factors contributing to the economic loss?

## Data sources:

Multiple data sources from data.gov, providing wildfire and climate data, and additional sources covering economic data connected with hazards and disasters.

## Expected results:

I expect to produce a tool that can be used to identify the most vulnerable economic zones where hazards such as wildfires would have the greatest impact.

## Expected techniques:

I intend to use the techniques learned thus far in this course; specifically linear regression and random forest classification (pun intended). Additionally, I'll use several other techniques to explore the data more in depth.

## The Importance:

Several high-profile fires have devastated small local economies. While there are contributing factors outside of the ignition of a fire, in some cases it's poor management of the area or lacking maintenance of equipment, but the indications of risk can enable decision makers to understand the risks and redirect resources or focus on mitigation.

### This is the process I'll follow

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Load the dataset into the python notebook
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and variables.
   - Check for missing values, outliers, or any data inconsistencies and handle them appropriately.
   - Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
   - Identify the relevant features or variables that are most important for my analysis.
   - Create new features or combine existing ones if needed to capture relevant information.
   - Consider normalizing or scaling the features if required.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conduct statistical analysis and visualization to gain insights into the data.
   - Analyze the distribution of variables, correlations, and trends.
   - Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, or geographical maps to understand patterns and relationships.

4. Model Selection and Training:
   - Determine the appropriate machine learning models based on my project goals (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
   - Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.

5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
   - Assess the performance of the trained models on the testing data.
   - Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error, depending on the problem type.
   - Interpret the model results and identify the most important features or patterns that contribute to the vulnerability assessment.

6. Visualization and Communication:
   - Create informative and visually appealing visualizations to present my findings.
   - Use charts, graphs, maps, or interactive dashboards to communicate the results effectively.
   - Prepare a clear and concise report or presentation summarizing my analysis, key insights, and recommendations.

7. Iterative Refinement:
   - Iterate on the previous steps based on the insights gained and feedback received.
   - Refine my models, incorporate additional data sources, or explore different techniques to improve the analysis.
